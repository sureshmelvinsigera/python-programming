###  Goal
The goal is to create a class that represents a simple circle.

A Circle can be defined by either specifying the radius or the diameter, and the user can query the circle for either its radius or diameter.

Other abilities of a Circle instance:

- Compute the circle’s area
- Print the circle and get something nice
- Be able to add two circles together
- Be able to compare two circles to see which is bigger
- Be able to compare to see if there are equal
- (follows from above) be able to put them in a list and sort them

### You will use:

- properties
- a class method
- a define a bunch of “special methods”

### Solution
```python
from math import pi


class Circle:

    # constructor
    def __init__(self, the_radius):
        self.radius = the_radius  # <= by default public member or field
        self._diameter = the_radius * 2  # <= protected member or field
        self._area = pi * the_radius ** 2  # <= protected member or field

    # @property
    # def diameter(self):
    #     return self._diameter
    #
    # @diameter.setter
    # def diameter(self, value):
    #     self._diameter = value
    #     self.radius = value / 2

    # getter
    def get_diameter(self):
        return self._diameter

    # setter
    def set_diameter(self, value):
        self._diameter = value
        self.radius = value / 2

    # set diameter as our getter and setter
    diameter = property(get_diameter, set_diameter)

    # @property
    def area(self):
        return self._area

    # set area a getter
    area = property(area)

    # This method shared by all the objects, which is bound to the class
    @staticmethod
    def from_diameter(diameter):
        the_radius = diameter / 2
        return Circle(the_radius)

    # return our Circle object to a string
    def __str__(self):
        return "Circle with Radius: {}".format(self.radius)

    # object representation.It could be any valid python expression
    # such as tuple, dictionary, string etc
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Circle({})".format(self.radius)

    # To add two different circle radii or radiuses
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Circle(self.radius + other.radius)

    # For multiplication
    def __mul__(self, n_times):
        return Circle(self.radius * n_times)

    # to check if it's less than
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.radius < other.radius

    # to check if it's equal
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.radius == other.radius

    # __rmul__ = __mul__
    #
    # def __truediv__(self, other):
    #     return Circle(self.radius / other.radius)


# Circle 1 Object
c1 = Circle(4)
print(c1.radius)
print(c1.diameter)
c1.diameter = 2
print(c1.radius)
print(c1.area)
x = c1.from_diameter(8)
print(x.diameter)

# Circle 2, 3, 4, and 5 Objects
c2 = Circle(0)
c3 = Circle(4.1)
c4 = Circle(6)
c5 = Circle(1.1)

# put all the circle objects inside the list named circles
circles = [c1, c2, c3, c4]

# sort and print all the objects
print(sorted(circles))
print(c1 * 4)
